* [StitchPics](https://stitchpics.net/#!/app) - Turns any picture into a cross stitch pattern right in the browser
* [Beep.js](https://github.com/Klathmon/Beep.js) - A stupid-simple wrapper around the WebAudio API to make it easier to use
* [BitPacker.js](https://github.com/Klathmon/BitPacker.js) - A small library to quickly convert between 4 8-bit "colors" to a 32-bit "packed" number. Useful for doing image operations on the CPU in javascript faster.
